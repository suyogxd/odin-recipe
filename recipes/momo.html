    <p>"Dumpling" is broad term that spans across cuisines and can vary greatly depending on where you're eating. Typically in Asian cuisines, a dumpling is a thin wheat-based dough filled with meats, or other proteins, and vegetables before being folded up and either steamed, boiled, or fried. The main difference from country to country is the preferred fillings and how the dough is folded. China has jiaozi, Mongolia serves buuz, Nepal enjoys momo, Korea plates up mandu, and gyoza (listed further below) is a staple in Japan.</p>
    <p>By purchasing generic dumpling wrappers — also sometimes referred to as "dumpling skins" — you'll have a world of flavors to play with. Typically made with wheat flour and round in shape, store-bought dumpling wrappers can be steamed, boiled in soups, or fried. Depending on which international dumpling type you're trying to replicate, its typical dough may be a little thicker or thinner, but by using the store-bought version you'll have a basic stand-in for experimenting.</p>
