    <p>Lemon chicken breasts is a flavorful and aromatic dish that combines the juicy tenderness of chicken with the bright and zesty essence of lemon. This dish is typically prepared by marinating or coating chicken breasts in a mixture infused with lemon juice and zest, which imparts a refreshing tanginess to the meat. Often, the chicken is pan-seared, grilled, or baked, allowing the citrusy marinade to create a beautiful glaze and keep the chicken moist and succulent. The result is a dish that strikes a perfect balance between savory and tangy flavors, making it a popular choice for a light and satisfying meal. The lemon chicken breasts can be served with a variety of sides such as vegetables, rice, or salad, enhancing its appeal as a versatile and delicious entr√©e.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup good olive oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic (9 cloves)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (2 lemons)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves </li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 boneless chicken breasts, skin on (6 to 8 ounces each)</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
</ul>
<h1>Process</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Warm the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add the garlic, and cook for just 1 minute but don't allow the garlic to turn brown. Off the heat, add the white wine, lemon zest, lemon juice, oregano, thyme, and 1 teaspoon salt and pour into a 9 by 12-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Pat the chicken breasts dry and place them skin side up over the sauce. Brush the chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle them liberally with salt and pepper. Cut the lemon in 8 wedges and tuck it among the pieces of chicken.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken breasts, until the chicken is done and the skin is lightly browned. If the chicken isn't browned enough, put it under the broiler for 2 minutes. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and serve hot with the pan juices.</li>
